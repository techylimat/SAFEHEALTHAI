## Project Overview

**SafeHealth AI** is a rapid, deployable **Computer Vision system** that uses **Zero-Code Automation** to instantly report community health hazards, transforming slow, reactive municipal response into proactive health defense.

The system is designed to provide immediate alerts upon detection of critical environmental risks: **trash piles**, **stagnant water**, and **blocked drains**.

## Key Features & Technical Stack

| Category | Technology              | Feature | Impact |
| :--- |:------------------------| :--- | :--- |
| **Detection Core** | **Custom YOLOv8 Model** | Real-time Object Detection | High-accuracy identification of three key hazard classes. |
| **User Interface** | **Streamlit**           | Interactive Web App | User-friendly platform for image upload and visual results. |
| **Data Reporting** | **Pandas**              | Structured Data Summary | Generates a clean table (Confidence, Coordinates) for reporting. |
| **Automation Edge** | **Webhooks + Zapier**   | Zero-Code Alert System | Instant, automated hazard reporting via HTTP POST request, bypassing complex email server setup. |

## Get Started

### 1. **Clone the Repository**

```bash
git clone [https://github.com/YourUsername/SafeHealth-AI.git](https://github.com/YourUsername/SafeHealth-AI.git)
cd SafeHealth-AI

---

### 2. Environment Setup
Ensure you have a Python virtual environment activated.

Bash

# Activate your environment (e.g., source .venv/bin/activate)
# ...

### 3. Install Dependencies
Install all required libraries, including ultralytics, streamlit, pandas, requests, and python-dotenv.

Bash

pip install -r requirements.txt
# Ensure you also manually install the dependency for data formatting:
pip install tabulate

### 4. Model Weights & Configuration
Place your trained model weights (best.pt) in the location specified by MODEL_PATH in streamlit_app.py.

Create a file named .env in the project root to securely store your automation URL:

# .env file content (DO NOT COMMIT THIS FILE TO GIT)
ALERT_WEBHOOK_URL="[YOUR_SECRET_ZAPIER_OR_IFTTT_URL_HERE]"
💻 How to Run the Application
With your environment activated and dependencies installed, launch the Streamlit app:

Bash

streamlit run apps/streamlit_app.py
The app will open automatically in your browser at http://localhost:8501.

🚨 Automation Workflow
The system is configured to trigger an automated alert when a hazard is detected:

User uploads image and clicks "Start Hazard Analysis."

Python's requests library sends a JSON payload containing the Detection Summary Table (generated by Pandas) to the ALERT_WEBHOOK_URL.

The Webhook (e.g., on Zapier) catches the data and triggers an Action (e.g., sending a formatted email to the municipal response team).

This process reduces the hazard reporting time from days to mere seconds.

Hazard Classes
The model is trained to detect the following classes:

Trash (Risk of pollution, pests, and fire hazards)

Stagnant water (Potential breeding ground for mosquitoes/disease)

Blocked drain (Risk of flooding and infrastructural damage)

🤝 Contributing
We welcome feedback and future collaborations to expand the model's capabilities and integrate with municipal APIs.
